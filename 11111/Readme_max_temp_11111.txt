Abu sir has given us raw dataset for maximum temperatures for 4 weather stations of Dhaka city. They are station id : 11111, 41909, 11505, 11513. 1st Nafisa took the raw dataset and preprocessed it. She scaled the dataset (drop.py and Processed_Max_Temp_Data.xlsx) and implemented knn imputation on the raw dataset (knn.py and Processed_Max_Temp_Data_Imputed.xlsx). Then Meherin handled outlier from this file (outlier_11111.py and outlier_processed_max_temp_station_11111.xlsx). Then SSA algorithm is implemented in this output file (2d_ssa_11111.py and 2d_ssa_reconstructed_11111_max_temp.xlsx). Then Nafisa analyzed some trend, seasonality, noise from this ssa reconstructed data (). In the ssa reconstructed dataset Meherin has implemented Time series split ( K-fold time series split cross validation (EWKCV)----split.py and "splits" folder) for RF and SVR machine learning algorithm. Then SVR is implemented on the dataset of split folder (svr_max_temp_11111.py and svr_prediction folder for output data).
